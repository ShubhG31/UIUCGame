2.1 Bugs:



   (1)
   (2)  While implementing the status bar, the VGA was reading the buffer for the status bar incorrectly, It was causing the status bar to be discolored,
        and not have anything legible. It was a algorithmic bug. The cause was the text graphic not being correctly mapped to the planar buffer for the VGA display. So the loop
        that maps the VGA Status bar buffer had to be corrected to increment every 4th iterations rather than every single time. Finding this bug took 
        a couple hours, it was hard to figure out how to convert the graphic. It was a 1 line fix.
